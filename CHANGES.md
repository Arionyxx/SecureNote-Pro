### User Experience:
```
App starts → "Trial expires in 2:00"
After 1 min → "Trial expires in 1:00"
            → 🚨 POPUP: "Only 1 minute remaining!"
After 1:30  → "Trial expires in 0:30"
            → 🚨 POPUP: "Only 30 seconds remaining!"
After 2:00  → "Trial EXPIRED - Activate now!"
            → 🚨 POPUP: "Trial expired! Features locked!"
```

## 🎯 Why These Changes?

### Educational Value:
1. **Realistic Protection** - Mimics aggressive trial software
2. **Time Pressure** - Real-world trial limitations
3. **Strong Motivation** - Users NEED to crack it to use it
4. **Multiple Challenges:**
   - Extend 2-minute trial
   - Remove 3-note limit
   - Remove 10-save limit
   - Bypass countdown timer
   - Skip warning popups

### Reverse Engineering Opportunities:

**Easy Challenges:**
- Modify trial time constant (2 minutes → longer)
- Increase note limit (3 → 999)
- Increase save limit (10 → 999)

**Medium Challenges:**
- Disable countdown timer
- Remove warning popups
- Reset trial when expired
- Patch time checks

**Hard Challenges:**
- Make timer always show "∞"
- Bypass all time checks universally
- Memory patch to freeze timer
- Hook timer functions

## 💡 Tips for Users

### To Use the App Properly:
**Option 1:** Use a valid license key (see README.md)
```
SK4N-0G7A-4NDI-4L75
2MBL-7S5X-CNQI-3L8N
XWMQ-A39T-0VKA-0T9I
```

**Option 2:** Reverse engineer and crack it! 🔓

### To Practice Cracking:
1. Run the app and watch the timer
2. Let it expire (wait 2 minutes)
3. Try to create 4th note (blocked!)
4. Now find and patch these limits!

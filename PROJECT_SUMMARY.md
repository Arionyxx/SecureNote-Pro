## 💡 Hints for Getting Started

### First Steps with dnSpy

1. **Download dnSpy:**
   - https://github.com/dnSpy/dnSpy/releases
   - Download dnSpy-netframework.zip

2. **Open the DLL:**
   - Run dnSpy.exe
   - File > Open
   - Navigate to: `REVERSE-ENGINEER\SecureNotePro\bin\Release\net8.0-windows\SecureNotePro.dll`

3. **Find the Feature Gate:**
   - In the Assembly Explorer (left pane)
   - Expand SecureNotePro
   - Expand Protection
   - Click on FeatureGate
   - Double-click `CheckFeatureAccess` method

4. **Make Your First Patch:**
   - Right-click `CheckFeatureAccess` method
   - Choose "Edit Method (C#)..."
   - Change to: `return true;`
   - Click "Compile"
   - File > Save Module
   - Run the patched exe!

### Understanding the License Algorithm

The license key format is: `XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX`

Structure:
- First 8 chars (XXXX-XXXX): Must sum to value divisible by 7
- Next 4 chars (XXXX): Random data
- Last 4 chars (XXXX): Checksum of first 12 chars

Look at these methods:
1. `ValidateFormat()` - Checks format
2. `ValidateChecksum()` - Checks checksum
3. `CalculateChecksum()` - The algorithm
4. `GenerateLicenseKey()` - How to create keys
